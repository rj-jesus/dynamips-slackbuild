dynamips emulates Cisco routers on a traditional PC. You can use it to
create labs. It uses real Cisco IOS Images, which are not included in
this  package.

Of course, this emulator cannot replace a real router.  Instead it is
a complementary tool to real labs for administrators of Cisco networks
or people wanting to pass their CCNA/CCNP/CCIE exams.

dynamips is generally used together with gns3.
