# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

dynamips: dynamips (cisco router emulator)
dynamips:
dynamips: Emulates Cisco routers on a traditional PC. You can use dynamips to
dynamips: create labs. It uses real Cisco IOS Images, which are not included in
dynamips: this package. Of course, this emulator cannot replace a real router.
dynamips: It is simply a complementary tool to real labs for administrators of
dynamips: Cisco networks or people wanting to pass their CCNA/CCNP/CCIE exams.
